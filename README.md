Stakeholder: Seattle Police Department.

### Background:

Seattle is the home place of grunge music, a tech hub and a city that prides itself in progress and innovation. It is a beautiful city that is surrounded by lush landscapes and deserves a place on your itinerary.

According to the most recent data from the FBI, the total crime rate in Seattle is 5,081.0 per 100,000 people. That's 105.15% higher than the national rate of 2,476.7 per 100,000 people and 70.75% higher than the Washington total crime rate of 2,975.8 per 100,000 people.

Seattle saw substantial spikes in the number of aggravated assaults and robberies last year, which were largely responsible for the 20% overall increase in violent crime the city experienced in 2021, according to the Seattle Police Department’s year-end crime report.

That report, released late last week, said the number of aggravated assaults that occurred in Seattle last year — 3,925 — is the most the city has seen in 10 years. It also represents a 24% increase over 2020 totals.
